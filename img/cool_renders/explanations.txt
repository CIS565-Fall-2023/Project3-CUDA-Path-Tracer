001 - basic path tracing, but I didn't realize that the lambert term is canceled out by the PDF (see here: https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/9499/confusion-around-lamberts-cosine-law-in-ray-tracing-in-one-weekend)
002 - sorting just the intersections but not sorting the segments in tandem (seen while debugging thrust sort)
003 - perfectly specular glass ball with another one behind it (not correct though since normals inside sphere were flipped automatically)
004 - glass but correct this time
005 - I have no idea lol, seems like the first bounce cache screwed something up (wasn't even enabled but I was working on it at the time)
006 - two boxes scene
007 - dof first attempt
008 - dof second attempt
009 - dof but clearly wrong since there's weird vertical lines
010 - dof works this time after I fixed input parameter to makeSeededRandomEngine (changed segment.bouncesSoFar to segment.remainingBounces)
011 - monkey (seems like the normals are a bit messed up though)
012 - monkey normals
013 - monkey at an angle (doesn't look right)
014 - testing barycentric coords
015 - monkey normals for comparison with #014
