### (TODO: Your README)

*DO NOT* leave the README to the last minute! It is a crucial part of the
project, and we will not be able to grade you without a good README.

### Log
09.20
- Basic raytracer
- Refactor integrator
- First triangle!

09.21-22
- Load arbitrary scene(only geom)
    - Triangle
    - ~~Primitive assemble phase~~(This will not work, see `README` of this commit)
    - Use tinygltf
        Remember to check [data type]((https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#accessor-data-types)) before using accessor
    ![Alt text](img/accessor_data_types.png)
    - Done with loading a scene with node tree!
            ![blender_reference](img/blender_reference.png)
            ![rendered](img/first_scene.png)
        > Can't tell how excited I am! Now my raytracer is open to most of the scenes!
        - Scene with parenting relationship
            ![with_parenting](img/scene_with_parenting.png)

09.23-09.26
> Waste too much time on OOP. Eventually used C-style coding.

09.26
Finally, finish gltf loading and basic bsdf.

- A brief trial
    - Note that this difference might be due to different bsdf we are using right now. For convenience, we are using the most naive Diffuse BSDF, while Blender use a standard BSDF by default.

09.27

Naive BVH (probably done...)
Scene with 1k faces
- One bounce, normal shading
    - Without BVH: FPS 10.9
    ![Alt text](img/normal_shading_without_bvh.png)

    - With BVH: FPS 53.4
    ![Alt text](img/normal_shading_with_bvh.png)
    - 5 times faster
- Multiple bounces
    - Without BVH: FPS 7.6
        ![Alt text](img/multiple_bounces_without_bvh.png)
    - With BVH: FPS 22.8
        ![Alt text](img/multiple_bounces_with_bvh.png)


09.28

- SAH BVH(probably done...)

- Texture sampling
    - Try billboarding
    ![Alt text](img/billboarding.png)

09.29

- Texture mapping
    - Texture mapping test(only baseColor shading)
    ![Alt text](img/texture_mapping_test.png)
    - Bump mapping
        - Normals in world coordinate
    ![](img/bump_mapping_world_coord.png)
        - Before bump mapping
    ![](img/bump_mapping_before_annotated.png)
        - After bump mapping
    ![](img/bump_mapping_after_annotated.png)
    It might be a little difficult to notice the difference before and after bump mapping. **Please observe the logo on the box, more details are added.**


    - [ ] Texture aliasing is indeed quite serious!
        - [ ] However, to implement antialiasing for texture mapping, I may need to consider implementing mipmapping. 

- [ ] Microfacet model pbr failed...
    - [ ] Need to read through microfacet part and think about how to use roughness and metallic indeed

09.30

- [ ] Microfacet
    - [x] Metal Fresnel hack
    - [ ] Conductor
        - [ ] After mixing, need to consider how to sample
- [x] Camera 
    - [x] Antialiasing

10.1-10.2
Try to refactor camera
- Failed. gltf seems to have a really ambiguous definition of camera.

10.3
- [ ] Denoising
    - [x] OpenImage Denoiser built
        - CPU only for now
        - [ ] Figure out how to build `oidn` for cuda
    - [ ] Integrate it into project


10.4-10.6

- Microfacet

10.7 

- Environment map

10.8

- Fix random number issue(Maybe try to generate a better random number array in future?)
    - Before
![](img/before_fixing_random_number_issue.png)
    - After
![](img/after_fixing_random_number_issue.png)

    **Please notice the fracture on rabbit head before fixing**

10.9
- MIS (Finally!)

- Russian Roulette 
    - Pro: Speed up by 60%
    - Con: Lower the converge speed


- Depth of field
    - Add a realtime slider to adjust
