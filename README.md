# Overview
![Unlock FPS](img/cornell.2023-09-29_13-31-12z.1734samp.png)
This project is a Monte Carlo path tracer run on GPU based on CUDA. It is a rendering algorithm that simulates the behavior of light in a scene by tracing rays from the camera into the scene. Using a GPU and CUDA for Monte Carlo path tracing allows for massive parallelization, speeding up the ray tracing and light simulation steps. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model that enables efficient utilization of the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.
